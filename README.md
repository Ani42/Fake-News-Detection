- Fake news is a very common problem these days which can lead to the spread of misinformation and false facts. The task of assessing the veracity of a news article is a complicated one.
- However, a first step that can be taken in identifying fake news is to detect the stance of two pieces of text, i.e estimating the relative perspective of two pieces of text
# We use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to tackle this problem.
- We have improved upon a previously developed baseline model whose repository can be found [here](https://github.com/FakeNewsChallenge/fnc-1-baseline)

The image below, taken from the official website, clearly illustrates the task. A news headline and article are taken and the relation between them is classified into 4 classes -- (unrelated, agrees, disagrees, discusses)

## The neural network architecture we built is shown below
